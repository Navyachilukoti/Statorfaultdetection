Overview: Mechanical faults in industrial machinery can lead to significant operational disruptions, increased maintenance costs, and safety hazards. Traditional fault detection methods, relying on manual inspections and heuristic analysis, are labor-intensive and prone to errors. This project addresses these limitations by leveraging machine learning techniques to provide a robust solution for fault detection and classification.

Process:

Dataset Collection: Historical sensor data from machinery, capturing normal operations and known faults, is collected.
Data Preprocessing: Relevant features, such as vibration patterns and temperature fluctuations, are extracted and analyzed to distinguish between normal and faulty conditions.
Train-Test Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to develop and evaluate the machine learning models.
Machine Learning Classifier: Various classifiers, including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, are implemented and trained on the labeled data to recognize different fault types.
Output Prediction: The trained model is used to predict faults from new, unseen sensor data, providing real-time predictions and alerts for timely maintenance actions.
